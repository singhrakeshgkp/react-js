# Table of contents
- Forms Handling
 
# Basic
#### Branch 6-form-handling-1
- If we submit the form, by default it will refresh all the value what we entered earlier to avoid this we can use ```event.preventDefault()```

#### Branch 6-form-handling-2 ref
- use cases
 - if we want an input field is focused as soon as page is load.
   - we can achive this using two ways. first way using ```React.createRef()```  this is recomended way. Second way using call back this is legacy
 - fetch the input value with ref
